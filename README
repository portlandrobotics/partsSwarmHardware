Clone this project into the your Arduino sandbox's hardware subdirectory to add 
support for the brushbots comm board.

WARNING: the Eagle PCB CAD files in the "BrushBot Eagle Files" folder are
(as of 4/17/2013) for the original board, which has an error on D6 and D7 of
BrushBotComm_C.  DO NOT BUILD THIS BOARD AS IS if you want the FET motor drivers
to work!  A revised schematic and board layout will be posted soon.

The hardware folder will be picked up by the Arduino software and used to 
augment its list of supported boards.

You must select one of the BrushBot Comm Board selections that will now appear 
under the Arduino Tools -> Board menu in order to build sketches for your
BrushBot.

If the Arduino software was open when you cloned this project into your Sandbox,
you'll need to restart the Arduino software for the new menu items to appear.
